# PYNQ_RADIO
Embedded application that uses an antenna to capture raw I/Q data packets from within the FM Radio band  over the air, process the raw data, send the data from the SDR PYNQZ2 board to a client PC, and play back the data. This project was completed using Matlab for signal processing and Python on Linux for interfacing with SDR via the PYNQ SoC.
